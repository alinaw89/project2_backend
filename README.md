# COMPACT - Back End


##ABOUT
COMPACT is a rails app that allows users to track inventory of their cosmetic items. Users can upload items and view them in their virtual cosmetic bag.

The app can be viewed at http://alinaw89.github.io/project2_frontend/#


##Description

This is a project created for GA to test our ability to create a functional Rails app.

I utilized an ORM, Active Record, to create a database table for three related models (cosmetic products, users and categories). I also used front-end Javascript to communicate with my API which can be viewed at https://github.com/alinaw89/project2_frontend.

If given more time, I would like to create the edit action to edit/update cosmetic products, and I would like to refactor my code to make it more DRY.


##Install
To begin, run bundle install and install the paperclip plugin

If you would like to begin with an initial user and sample data, run rake db:seed and utilize the following login information:
